# Test Repository for Code Review

This repository is intended for testing purposes. It contains sample Java and Python files that can be used to check and validate code quality analysis tools.

## Repository Contents

- **Python Files**: Sample Python files demonstrating various coding styles and potential issues. These files are useful for testing metrics such as cyclomatic complexity, maintainability, and other static analysis checks.
- **Java Files**: Sample Java files that include methods, classes, and intentional issues to test static analysis, such as exception handling, immutability, and code structure.

## Purpose

The primary goal of this repository is to serve as a testbed for code review and analysis tools. It can be used to:
- Validate the performance of static analysis tools like PyLint (for Python) and PMD (for Java).
- Measure code quality metrics such as cyclomatic complexity, maintainability, and code duplication.
- Generate AI-powered suggestions for code improvements.
- Provide a controlled environment to test and improve the Advanced Code Review Bot or similar tools.

## How to Use

1. **Clone the Repository**

   Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/test-repository.git
   cd test-repository
   ```

2. **Run Your Analysis Tool**

   If you're using a code review tool (e.g., the Advanced Code Review Bot), configure it to point to this repository. For example, set the repository name in your configuration:

   ```python
   REPO_NAME = "B-Praveenkumar10/testrepo"
   ```

3. **Review the Report**

   After running your analysis tool, review the generated report (e.g., `code_review_report.md`) to see detailed metrics, detected issues, and suggested improvements.
